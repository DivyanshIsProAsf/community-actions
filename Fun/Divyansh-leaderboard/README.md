You can use this action to retrieve a leaderboard for anything. Atlas will do the work for you by sorting all the data, displaying it correctly, handling all the errors (if any), making the buttons and more!. 

HOW TO SETUP THE ACTION
1) Import the action into your server
2) To add a user to the leaderboard, use the `/editpoint` command and the required flags to add to the user's points. It supports negative values to remove the points as well!
3) After adding at least one user you will be able to view the lb!

Please report any bugs to divyansh. *There might be a VERY delayed reply and an even delayed fix due to me having a life :)*
