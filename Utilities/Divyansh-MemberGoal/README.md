This is a Goal action for servers to display their member count along with a goal for the members to aim for.

How to set it up?
- First import the action
- Then, change the "botcount" to the number of bots in your server
- Change the "goal interval" to the interval you want your goal to update with. It will update dynamically with the number of members in your server.
- You are all done

Now, your members can use `/goal` to view the goal and the current member count along with a progress bar. 
It also displays a congratulations message once a goal has been reached!

Any bugs can be reported to `Divyansh.`!
