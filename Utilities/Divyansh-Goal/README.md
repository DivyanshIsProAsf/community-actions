This is a goal command for your members to use to view the goal and the current member count

How to set it up?
- After importing the action, change the `botcount` to the number of bots in your server
- Then change the `goalinterval` to the interval you want the goal to update. It will update dynamically
- You are all set

Now, your members can run `/goal` to view the member count and the current goal along with a progress bar
It also has a congratulations message for when the goal is reached!
